                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Witcher</strong>, Andrzej Sapkowski's epic fantasy series, has gained immense popularity and has been a major influence on the gaming and entertainment industries. The series has been adapted into video games and a Netflix original series, captivating audiences with its intricate storyline and memorable characters. In this research, we will provide an in-depth exploration of the world of The Witcher 2, highlighting its crucial characters and communities, for those who have yet to experience the latest season of the show.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
                    <p>The main objectives of this research are to identify and analyze the most significant characters in The Witcher 2 series and to gain a better understanding of the various communities that exist within its richly detailed universe. In this project, we will discuss two questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>What are the most important characters?</li>
                    <li>What are the main communities in the Witcher 2 series?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Planning:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Use Selenium, a web scraping tool, to extract character names from The Witcher Wiki.</li>
                    <li>Process the data by converting the books into sentences and using Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and classify characters' named entities.</li>
                    <li>Define a "box" of sentences in which the characters' names are mentioned between these sentences. If this condition is met, we can infer that the characters mentioned in these sentences have a relationship with each other.</li>
                    <li>Use Pyvis, a Python library for visualizing networks, to plot the relationships between characters and communities. This will allow us to gain a better understanding of the complex web of relationships that exists within The Witcher series.</li>
                    </ul>
